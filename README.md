## The Problem

* From April to September last year there was a 23% rise in food parcels being distributed from food banks to those in need (compared against the previous year).
* 94% of users face real destitution.
* 23% of users are homeless.
* Food donation fluctuate wildly and it’s difficult to maintain steady stocks.

## Our Solution

* Our aim is to give the public a web application that’s easy to access where they can easily find their local food bank and a list of the items each food bank needs.
* Users can then add those items to a shopping list in the app - making it really simple to view what to purchase on their next shopping trip.
* There is also the option to add in other items that user might want to purchase as well.
* With gamification, we give users even more of a sense of achievement when they donate food!
